## Setup

Before you can run the application, you'll need to set up Supabase and Stripe.

### 1. Supabase Setup

- [Create a Supabase account](https://supabase.io/).
- Create a new project and note down your **Supabase URL** and **API Key**.
- Set up the database schema according to the `supabase/schema.sql` file included in this project.
- Configure the `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-api-key>
```

### 2. Stripe Setup

- [Create a Stripe account](https://stripe.com/).
- Set up your pricing plans in Stripe and get your **API Key**.
- Update the `.env` file with your Stripe keys:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-stripe-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
```

## Running the Project

Once you've configured Supabase and Stripe, you can run the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application in action.

## How to Use

### 1. User Authentication
Users can sign up or log in to the application using their email address. The authentication is powered by Supabase, providing a seamless and secure experience.

### 2. Booking Management
Users can view their upcoming bookings, create new bookings, and cancel/delete existing bookings. All bookings are stored in the Supabase database.

### 3. Payment and Subscription
Users can choose from different subscription plans. Stripe handles the payment processing, and subscription data is stored in the database.

### 4. Dashboard
The dashboard displays an overview of the user's bookings and subscription status. It also provides a form to create new bookings.

## Technologies

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Supabase**: Used for authentication, real-time database, and storage.
- **Context API**: Efficient state management for the user session and bookings.
